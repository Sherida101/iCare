## Customise 'Contact Us Page' to make it your own

## Drawbacks

- Any user can be an administrator because there is no approval required for an admin account.
- The admin sign-up process can be disabled then,a logic like creating superuser can be used.
- At least one doctor should be in the hospital before a patient can be admitted. Ensure that a doctor is added first.
- Update password first on the Update page of A doctor or patient
